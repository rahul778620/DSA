# Given an array of intervals where intervals[i] = [starti, endi], merge all overlapping intervals,
#  and return an array of the non-overlapping intervals that cover all the intervals in the input.

# Example 1:

# Input: intervals = [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
# Output: [[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
# Explanation: Since intervals [1,3] and [2,6] overlap, merge them into [1,6].
# Example 2:

# Input: intervals = [[1,4],[4,5]]
# Output: [[1,5]]
# Explanation: Intervals [1,4] and [4,5] are considered overlapping.
